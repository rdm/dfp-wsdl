To use:

[1] Make sure that VERSION is plausible. These are potentially plausible values:

    v201805
    v201808
    v201811
    v201902
    v201905
    ...

Basically google has been cutting a new release of this service
every quarter, so the last two digits come from the set 
{02,05,08,11} and the first two digits identify a year.

[2] Make sure that VERSION is valid. Google does not cut releases
in the future and mostly "turns them off" after they have lived for
two years.

CAUTION:

When dealing with old ad networks, the result format has been
different from the result format when dealing with most ad networks.
(I do not know grandfathered ad networks always follows the same
release schedule as the wsdl release schedule. But I imagine that
if you have paid them enough money they be somewhat interested in
catering to your needs.)
